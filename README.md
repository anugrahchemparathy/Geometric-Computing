# Geometric-Computing
Implementations for 6.850 Geometric Computing


PS1ClosestPair2D contains an implementation/interactive demonstration of an O(n log(n)) algorithm for determining the closest pair of points in a set.
- CoreImplementation: a folder of just the core implementation details for recursive closest pair 
- Visualization: a folder containing all the tools (and revisions of the CoreImplementation code needed to implement the visualization) used to create the html canvas visualization in index.html

The naive approach to finding the closest pair is an O(n^2) brute force. This is an implementation of the much more interesting recursive O(n log(n)) algorithm. For those curious: [read this](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri/cs235/ClosestPair.pdf)!


A YouTube demonstration of the visualization can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6IsJGSgUcQ).

You can try the demo yourself [here](https://anugrahchemparathy.github.io/Geometric-Computing/PS1ClosestPair2D/Visualization/index.html)!.
