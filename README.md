# Geometric-Computing
Implementations for 6.850 Geometric Computing


PS1ClosestPair2D contains an implementation/interactive demonstration of an O(n log(n)) algorithm for determining the closest pair of points in a set.
- CoreImplementation: a folder of just the core implementation details for recursive closest pair 
- Visualization: a folder containing all the tools (some code reproduced with small changes) used to create the html canvas visualization in index.html

A YouTube demonstration of the visualization can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6IsJGSgUcQ](here).
